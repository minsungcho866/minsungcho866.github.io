                                <h4>I first knew this song while I was watching a 
                                youtube video of my favorite actor. Its been 5 <br>
                                years since I listened to this song. While I came
                                back to Newyork After summer break, I felt <br>
                                lonely living by myself. Then I found this song in 
                                my playlist by chance. I was comforted by this song <br>
                                and this is the reason why I wanted to
                                share this song. </h4></center>

                                (Too much for the man)<br>
                                (He couldn't make it)<br>
                                So, he's leaving the life he's come to know, oh<br>
                                He said he's going back to find<br>
                                (Going back to find)<br>
                                What's left of his world<br>
                                The world he left behind<br>
                                Not so long ago<br>
                                He's leaving (leaving)<br>
                                On that midnight train to <br>Georgia (leaving on a midnight train)<br>
                                Hmm, yeah<br>
                                Said he's going back (going back to find)<br>
                                To a simpler place and time <br>(and when he takes that ride)<br>
                                Oh yes, he is (guess who's gonna <br>sit right by his side)<br>
                                And I'll be with him (I know you will)<br>
                                On that midnight train to Georgia<br>
                                (Leaving on a midnight train to Georgia)<br>
                                I'd rather live in his world (live in his world)<br>
                                Than live without him in mine (world, world)<br>
                                (It's his, his and hers alone)<br>
                                He kept dreaming<br>
                                (Dreaming)<br>
                                Oh, that someday he'd be a star<br>
                                (A superstar, but he didn't get far)<br>
                                But he sure found out the hard way<br>
                                That dreams don't always come <br>true (dreams don't always come true)<br>
                                Oh no (uh-uh, no, uh-uh)<br>
                                So he hung all his hopes<br>
                                And he even sold his own car, hmm<br>
                                Bought a one way ticket back<br>
                                To the life that he once knew<br>
                                Oh yes he did<br>
                                He said he would<br>
                                I know he's leaving (leaving)<br>
                                On that midnight train to Georgia <br>(leaving on a midnight train)<br>
                                Hmm, yeah<br>
                                Said he's going back to find, oh <br>(going back to find)<br>
                                A simpler place and time <br>(and when he takes that ride)<br>
                                (Guess who's gonna sit <br>right by his side)<br>
                                And, I'm gonna be with him (I know you will)<br>
                                On that midnight train to Georgia<br>
                                (Leaving on the midnight <br>train to Georgia)<br>
                                I'd rather live in his world <br>(live in his world)<br>

                                Yeah, oh yo<br>
                                Said he's going back to find<br>
