<h2>Reason Why I Chose This Song </h2>
<p>This is the time when it was the time <br>
  towards midterm. I wanted a song that is <br>
  enerjetic and motivate me to work hardder. <br>
  I usually watch videos about history of <br>
  artists and I saw a video of Eminem where <br>
  I first listened to this song. While I was <br>
  doing my work, I wanted some loud music and<br>
  Therefore I chose this song.</p>

<h3>Listen to the Song</h3>

  <center>Something's burning, I can't figure out what (out what) <br>
  It's either lust or a cloud of dust, judgement is clouded<br>
  Must just be the powder from the power of (love)<br>
  But I'm in something I don't know how to get out of<br>
  Left my girl in the house alone<br>
  Is that my soon-to-be-spouse's moan?<br>
  And the further I walk, the louder<br>
  Pause for a minute to make certain that's what I heard<br>
  'Cause after all, this is her place<br>
  So I give her the benefit of the doubt, I<br>
  Think I might be about to bust her, bust her<br>
  The thought's scary, yo, though and it hurts, brace<br>
  Hope it ain't, "Here we go, yo"<br>
  'Cause my head already goes to worst case scenario<br>
  Though in the first place (ah, fuck)<br>
  But you confirmed my low-end theory, though<br>
  Should've known when I made it all the way to third base<br>
  And that was only the first date, could've made it to home plate<br>
  But you slid straight for the dome and dove face first<br>
  "No you don't understand, I don't do this for anyone, ever"<br>
  Yeah, that ain't what they all say? I'll say<br>
  You can suck a softball through a straw, used to be my fiancé<br>
  'Til you sucked on Wayne, André, and Kanye<br>
  Lebron, Akon, Jay, Lil Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e<br>
  Polow da Don, Dre, Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwamé<br>
  Guess I'm gettin' my g-goddang Jigga on, eh?<br>
  'Cause your name, I'm beyond sayin'<br>
  But fuck it, I'm movin' on, you women are all cray<br>
  But I'll probably always keep on playin'<br>
  The game of love (love), love (love)<br>
  La-la-la-la-la love<br>
  She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more<br>
  She hates my company, guess, she don't love me no more<br>
  I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door<br>
  She screamed she loved me like she never did before<br>
  And I told her (go where you wanna<br>
  Go do whatcha want to do, I don't care)<br>
  And I told her (go where you wanna<br>
  Go do whatcha want to do, I don't care)<br>
  I told that bitch<br>
  "I'm a sucker for love, you a sucker for dick"<br>
  Sucking dick in your momma tub, then your granny walked in<br>
  Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water, he drowned like an abortion<br>
  They booked you for manslaughter, you beat the case and I called ya<br>
  "Sherane is not available, now leave a message at the tone<br>
  And Kendrick, don't forget to buy two pair of those expensive heels<br>
  You little fucking Ferris Wheel, fucking spinning on me?<br>
  Fuck you think? We gon' get married still?<br>
  Fucking Mary had a little lamb, this ain't a fairy tale<br>
  Fairy godmomma better tell you how I fucking feel<br>
  Like you should fuckin' beat it or fucking eat it while I'm on my period<br>
  Now have a blessed day"<br>
  Bitch, you serious?<br>
  I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious<br>
  Why you ain't fucking with me? You cut me deep as Caesarean<br>
  You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious<br>
  I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman<br>
  After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killing him<br>
  His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem<br>
  That's analogy and metaphor for you<br>
  I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you<br>
  This is me talking cordial, yeah, I got some home trainin'<br>
  That ain't what you like, ain't it?<br>
  What about if I was as famous as Marshall?<br>
  Would you give fellatio in the carpool?<br>
  Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle<br>
  Singing, "I hope she's good enough<br>
  Meanwhile you're chasing her"<br>
  Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her<br>
  Pity the fool and pity the fool in me, I'ma live with the<br>
  Game of love (love), love (love)<br>
  La-la-la-la-la love<br>
  She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more<br>
  She hates my company, guess, she don't love me no more<br>
  I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door<br>
  She screamed she loved me like she never did before<br>
  And I told her (go where you wanna<br>
  Go do whatcha want to do, I don't care)<br>
  And I told her (go where you wanna<br>
  Go do whatcha want to do, I don't care)<br>
  So needless to say I'm feelin' betrayed<br>
  Snatch my house key off her key chain<br>
  She jumps off Wee-Bey from The Wire's dick<br>
  Now she's chasing me with a cheese grater<br>
  Here goes that broken record, cliché, it's all my fault anyway<br>
  She's turning the tables, I'm a beat-break<br>
  She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ<br>
  Each day is an instant replay<br>
  They say what we display is symptomatic of addict behavior<br>
  Back together but forgot today was her B-day<br>
  She cut me off on the freeway, simple misunderstanding<br>
  But just as I went to slam on the brakes<br>
  That's when I realized that she may be as crazy as me, wait<br>
  Bitch cut my fucking brake line, stepped on them fuckers eight times<br>
  Still goin' seventy-three, thank God there's an exit coming up<br>
  What the mother F-U-C-K's wrong with her?<br>
  Hit the off ramp 'til I coasted to a goshdamn halt<br>
  Hit a fucking tree, now here she comes at full speed<br>
  She's racing at me, okay, you wanna fuck with me, eh?<br>
  Snatch the bitch out her car through the window<br>
  She screamin', I body slam her on the cement<br>
  Until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole<br>
  Buried the stink ho in it, then pay to have the street repaved<br>
  (The fuck?) Woke up in a dream state, in a cold sweat<br>
  Like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave<br>
  Guess I eventually caved though, 'cause she's laying next to me in bed<br>
  Directly aiming a gat at my head, woke up again and jumped up like<br>
  "Fuck it, I've had it, I'm checking into rehab"<br>
  I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy<br>
  Every girl I've ever had either says I got too much baggage<br>
  Or I'm too fucking dramatic<br>
  Man, what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fucking romantic<br>
  I fucking love you, you fucking bitch<br>
  Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex<br>
  I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events<br>
  I said, "Hit the road" and after she left, I sent that bitch a text<br>
  I said, "Be careful driving, don't read this and have an accident"<br>
  She glanced to look at it and wrecked<br>
  Too bad, thought we had a connect, no sense dwelling makes<br>
  Never been a more compelling case<br>
  Than the model covered in L'Oreal and mace<br>
  Who fell from grace eleven stories for storytelling<br>
  While the whore was yelling, "Rape" 'til her vocal cords were swelling<br>
  And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spelling's face<br>
  Still they swarm the gates and my fancy estates<br>
  To greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace<br>
  'Less you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date, though<br>
  You're late, well, the sentiment's great<br>
  But wait, think there's been a mistake<br>
  You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate<br>
  I have infinite hate in my blood, it's mainly because of the game of<br>
  Wait, dinner at eight?<br>
  I have infinite hate in my blood, it's mainly 'cause of the<br>
  Game of love (love), love (love)<br>
  La-la-la-la-la love</marquee></div> </center>
