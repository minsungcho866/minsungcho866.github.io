                The reason why I chose this song for this week is because this week was a very busy week and I wanted a song<br>  
                that could make me energetic but also not to loud so that I can concentrate to my work. Therefore, while I was<br> 
                finding the right song, I saw a playlist that I made a year ago. In that playlist, I saw this song and decided to<br>
                 listen to this song for this week.</div></p>

                        he is widely regarded as one of the most influential rappers of his generation. His works, which regularly infuses social, 
                        political, religious, and philosophical influences, became a catalyst in the rise of social consciousness amongst Millennials.

                         cadences, artistic reinventions, and introspective songwriting. Lamar developed an interest in music and songwriting from a young age. He 
                         began releasing music as a teenager under the stage name K.Dot and signed with Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE) in 2005. After retiring his stage

                         the greatest concept album ever by Rolling Stone. Inspired by a visit to South Africa, Lamar embraced jazz and G-funk on his third album, To Pimp a 
                         Butterfly (2015). It became his first offour consecutive number-one projects in the U.S., and is one of the most critically acclaimed albums of

                         Lamar's critical and commercial success continued with his fourth album Damn (2017); which experimented with R&B, pop, and psychedelic soul. Yielding 
                         his second chart-topping single "Humble", the album is the first musical composition outside of the classical and jazz genres to be awarded the Pulitzer 
                         Prize for Music. Lamar received Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for his work on the Black Panther soundtrack (2018). Following a hiatus, he  
                         concluded his tenure with TDE via double album Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers (2022); it spawned the top-ten singles "N95", "Silent Hill" (with Kodak  
                         Black), and "Die Hard" (with Blxst and Amanda Reifer). Along with his solo career, Lamar performs as a member of the hip hop group Black Hippy, and has 
                         also co-founded the entertainment company and record label, PGLang with creative partner Dave Free. Heralded as a generational icon by the California 
                         State Senate, Lamar's accolades include seventeen Grammy Awards, including three Best Rap Album wins, a Primetime Emmy Award, a Brit Award, 
                         four American Music Awards, six Billboard Music Awards, 11 MTV Video Music Awards and 25 BET Hip Hop Awards; the most for any artist. He is one 
                         of the most-streamed rappers on Spotify, with all of his albums surpassing 1 billion streams each. Lamar was named MTV's Hottest MC in the Game in 
                         2012, and has been featured in listicles such as the Time 100 and Forbes 30 Under 30. Three of his albums were included in Rolling Stone's 2020 
                         revision of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Early life Kendrick Lamar Duckworth was born on June 17, 1987, in Compton, California, to Paula 
                         Oliver, a McDonald's worker, and Kenneth "Kenny" Duckworth, a KFC worker. His parents were from the South Side of Chicago and relocated to Compton 
                         three years before his birth due to his father's affiliation with the Gangster Disciples. Lamar is the eldest of four children and was named after 
                         singer-songwriter Eddie Kendricks of the Temptations. He was raised in a working class African American family, lived in Section 8 housing, and was 
                         reliant on welfare. Although he wasn't a member of a gang, he grew up among close affiliates of the Westside Piru Bloods. Lamar developed an interest 
                         in music when he was four years old after listening to the hip hop records his parents would play at their house parties. Some of his earliest 
                         childhood memories included watching his father and uncles rob stores during the 1992 Los Angeles riots. He credits the riots for giving him a better 
                         understanding of police brutality after learning about the beating of Rodney King. He was given the nickname "Man-Man" as a child because he carried 
                         himself as an adult. This nickname would later be used as a reference to his childhood in HUMBLE. and Family Ties. When he was five years old, Lamar 
                         witnessed his first murder while sitting outside of his apartment unit. He admitted during an interview with NPR Music that it "done something to me 
                         right then and there. It let me know that this is not only something that I'm looking at, but it's something that maybe I have to get used to." Three 
                         years later, he witnessed his second murder as he was walking home from Ronald E. McNair Elementary School. When he was eight years old, Lamar saw 
                         rappers Tupac Shakur and Dr. Dre film the music video for their single "California Love" in his neighborhood. The experience inspired him to pursue a 
                         recording career and he began freestyling soon after. He described himself as being quiet, shy, and observant in school; his mother stated that he was 
                         a loner until the age of seven. When he was a seventh-grade student at Vanguard Learning Center, Lamar was introduced to poetry by his English teacher
