                        I first listen to this music in the video where Kendrick Lamar was doing a live at Chanel Fashion show. <br>
                The reason why I chose this song for this week is because this week was a very busy week and I wanted a song<br>  
                that could make me energetic but also not to loud so that I can concentrate to my work. Therefore, while I was<br> 
                finding the right song, I saw a playlist that I made a year ago. In that playlist, I saw this song and decided to<br>
                 listen to this song for this week.</div></p>
